WS-Agreement Negotiation XML Types

  Java types are generated from XML schema. They provide a Java-to-XML binding 
  in order to access XML documents and data types of the WS-Agreement Negotiation   
  language from Java. The bindings are generated using XMLBeans. Have a look at 
  {{{http://xmlbeans.apache.org/documentation/tutorial_getstarted.html}Apache´s XMLBeans}}
  for a quick start.
